# Hello friends!
Hur ska vi strukturera detta dÃ¥? 
* 1d ? 2d? Bitboard?

# Hi friend!
Bitboard!

# TO DO
* get 1st bit from bitboard (get the index to it)
* add things to enum, like get_char_ascii and squareToCoord --> a8 == 'a8'
* Attack masks
* Generate moves
* is_square_attacked()
* Magic bitboard for bishop and rook attack masks
